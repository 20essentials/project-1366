This example explores using a Bloom Filter within Edge Middleware to quickly determine whether a request matches any entry in a large redirect list. The demo simulates a real-world scenario with 50,000 redirects, stored in a JSON file for convenience.

The storage format itself isn’t important to the approach. Whether the redirects live in a JSON file, a database, or another backing store, the same Bloom Filter–based strategy can be applied to optimize lookup performance.
